### Eariler

- NetAgg: Implement in-network aggregation via switch-attached high-performance middleboxes.
- CamDoop: They use servers in a direct-connect network topology.
- DAIET: Furthermore, it (refer to in-network aggregation) can help reducing network traffic, so as to alleviate congestion, which is a major cause of application performance degradation
- SHARP: Implement in dedicated switches, and the function is programmed in the chip.
