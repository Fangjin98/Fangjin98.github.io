I am a PhD student and a part of [USTC Intelligent Network and System Group](https://int-ustc.github.io/index.html) in the Department of Computer Science at University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by Prof. [Hongli Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xuhongli/) and Dr. [Gongmin Zhao](https://gmzhao-ustc.github.io/). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from the College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University (HNU) in 2020.

My research interest lies in the field of *programmable network*, *in-network computing* and *distributed training system*. You can view my CV [**here**](../pdf/resume.pdf).

If you have any questions, feel free to <a href="mailto:Fangjin98@outlook.com">contact me</a>.
